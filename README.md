# SourceBuild++
WIP of SourceBuild++

Main branch is the Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer branch (TF2 Update x64)  
Other branches should be self-explanatory by their names.  
Garry's Mod will most likely be unsupported as it contains proprietary code, while L4D2 & Portal 2 also contain custom code, they *might* be supported due to availability of custom SDKs on GitHub.  

note2self: mention that it supports stock, h++ & check for slammin' support  
add build instructions here & some other stuff also should probably write an "ABOUT" section
